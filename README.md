## about

If you don't want to install gradle system-wide, but rather rely on the gradle executables that come packaged with a gradle project, then you know the problem: you always have to call the wrapper in the project root dir. Kind of annoyingâ€¦So here's a small shell script, that searches for `gradlew` from your current path down to `/` and picks the first one it finds.

Also works with `zsh` auto completion!
